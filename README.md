# Social Media Application Project
- The Final Project for my Internet Programming course in the Summer 2025 semester. The goal of this project was to modify an already existing,
open source project using HTML, CSS, and PHP. The website was hosted on a LAMP server with a connected database used for validating user credentials,
and for sending messages and friend requests between users. The initial project can be found [here](https://github.com/abhn/simple-php-mysql-project).
